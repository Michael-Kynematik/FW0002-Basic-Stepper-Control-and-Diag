CODEX STANDING RULES (FW0002)

DEFAULT MODE
- Make changes directly in my workspace (edit files yourself).
- Keep changes small and reviewable.

AFTER EVERY CHANGE, YOU MUST OUTPUT
- Files changed (exact paths)
- What changed (1–3 bullets)
- Minimal test plan:
  1) idf.py build
  2) One hardware/CLI check
- STOP and wait for my results before continuing.

INVARIANTS
- main must always be flashable and testable on hardware without special steps.
- USB CDC console remains stable and usable on the known-good COM port.
- Minimum diagnostic commands must always work on main: help, uptime, reboot, snapshot.
- All CLI commands must produce deterministic output: OK/ERR or a single-line JSON record.
- snapshot must always be exactly one JSON line.

RESTRICTIONS
- Do not edit README or /docs unless I explicitly ask.
- If touching console/boot/CDC/UART transport, propose the exact diff + test plan first and wait for approval.
